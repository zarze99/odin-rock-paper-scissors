# Odin Rock Paper Scissors

This repository will contain my attempt at rock paper scissors project from The Odin Project (theodinproject.com). It will (hopefully) demonstrate my basic knowledge of Javascript and how to use a script in an HTML file. I will create a game where you can play against the computer (completely random) in rock paper scissors in the console.
